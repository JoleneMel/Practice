//Video 2 Static Arrays vs. Dynamic Arrays 
//Static arrays cannot be changed 
//Can make a new array, copying the old array and deleting the old array 
//Deleting is the system in reverse 

//Dynamic Arrays
//reserves more space then it needs allowing us to add elements to it
//Deleting can also basically the same but it needs to be 
//Benefit from Dynamic arrays are that you can change their size more easily- add and remove elements quickly 
//But if you are worried about space static may be better as a dynamic as previously mentioned takes up more space then it needs 


//Video 3 Intro to Linked Lists 
//Comparing arrays and linked lists, they are both used to store information 
//weaknesses of an array- space is limited when we add to it we need to alter a bit to make it correctly add to it 
//reserving space, making array, copying old array to new array, then deleting the old list, then you can add to that array 

//Linked List=Node 
//contains 2 points of pieces to it
//1.A place to store data
//2.next reference to the next node ahead of it, if there is only one element within that list it will refer the next part as null 
//In order to access the LinkedList we need the head pointer, we now have a linked list with one object 
//How to add a new list to this node length list? 
//We would start with creating a new node by placing it in memory, then putting it into the linked in once that is completed then that element will point
//to null, to join the two nodes you need to rid the old connection and create another note we create the new note, copy the information
//Delete the next pointer and have it now connect to our third node 
//Adding nodes is just repeating the process 
//how to delete a node, changing a pointer, some lanuages will automatically delete it for you
